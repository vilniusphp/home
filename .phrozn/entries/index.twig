          title: Just a typo? Drawing the line between data and logic
          description: |
            When the project grows, so does the team, and data being maintained.
            Have you wondered, why some typos had days, whole others, only minutes to release?
            Let's go trough different data types, tools (E.g. Prismic, GraphQL), principles (E.g. Test data, AB testing)
            and different times to release the change.
