          title: "Protocol Buffers for REST APIs (JSON-based) at Boozt Supply Chain"
          description: |
            While gRPC’s use of protocol buffers for data structure management is widely known, at Boozt, we took a different approach by enabling protocol buffers for JSON-based REST APIs. This method helped us address data structure management and sharing issues within our Supply Chain APIs. I’ll share our journey of implementing protocol buffers in this unconventional way, along with the tooling and practices we developed.

          title: "Building Really Fast Applications"
          description: |
            Let’s talk about performance. How can we make our applications run faster? What should we consider when starting a new project? While there are some quick fixes that I'll briefly cover, achieving truly fast response times requires dedication and effort. I’ll share my best ideas and tricks for building applications that respond in less than 15ms—and we'll aim to go even faster.
            Note: This is not a Varnish talk.
