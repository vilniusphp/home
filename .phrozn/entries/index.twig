          title: Dealing with dependencies
          description: |
            Open source dependencies are the foundation for every application.
            According to Synopsys.com OSSRA reports, each application depends on
            500 libraries on average and these numbers are rising year by year.
            But that has a cost: license compliance, vulnerabilities, outdated
            dependencies, and other risks. Let’s talk about how to tackle these
            problems and how automation can be applied.
