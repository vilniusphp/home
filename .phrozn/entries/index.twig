        - name: When code starts to “smell”
          title: "SOLID Principles In PHP"
          description: |
              Do you know that there are multiple signs of poor code quality?
              What if I tell you that code can go bad and start to "smell"? Bad
              code can function, but it's not at all easy or pleasant to work
              with. There's a way to tell and fix such surface indicators. Here
              at HomeToGo, we make sure our code is clean and easy to change.
        - name: Road to Kubernetes and autoscaling
          title: "Story of the robots: lessons learned while building our own WMS"
          description: |
              Kubernetes was introduced more than 6 years ago in the market and
              its adoption in enterprises is increasing year after year. In my
              presentation, I will focus on the basic concept of Kubernetes and
              how we adopted it in our application ecosystem.
