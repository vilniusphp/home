          title: "Practical use of Blockchain with PHP pt. 2"
          description: |
            Hi, I'm PHP developer Aurimas Tarasevičius from twoday Lithuania. In
            the presentation, we will continue our previous topic "Practical use
            of Blockchain with PHP." Last speech, I focused on the Algorand
            blockchain PHP library, and this time it will be about: BTC, DOGE,
            ETH, ADA… - these are blockchain-related buzzwords that I will
            mention in the overview of several PHP libraries, where I will show
            some code examples using them.

          title: Using internal tools to boost Customer Success workflow
          description: |
            What internal tools do we use at Hostinger to ensure success in the
            Customer Success department? Why does it work better for us than
            involving a third party? What problems do the internal tools solve?
