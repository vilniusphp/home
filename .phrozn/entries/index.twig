        - name: Irmantas Zenkus (Frontend architect at HomeToGo)
          title: Performance Budget
          description: |
            At HomeToGo we learned that making website speed better can be
            impactful for business multiple times. However, it has a tendency to
            degrade with further development efforts. A simple but robust
            budgeting instrument can keep your software in shape. I will show
            you how we did it and how it helped. I will reveal what challenges
            we face next.
        - name: Darius Kasiulevičius - Team Lead | Software Architect at HomeToGo
          title: Supply data processing evolution @ HomeToGo
          description: |
            HomeToGo integrates thousands of partner APIs to provide users with
            the best vacation home choice in the world. This is an exceptional
            challenge not only in scope but also in complexity. The partner data
            processing system being developed by my team processes hundreds of
            millions of updates every day to provide users with accurate
            vacation rental offers.  During the presentation, Darius will share
            the story of how the system evolved from a simple PHP process to a
            refined auto-scalable architecture using PHP, Scala, Apache Kafka,
            RabbitMQ, Aerospike, MariaDB, ElasticSearch, and many more. He will
            also tell more about how the team has coped with the challenges and
            why they are still continuously learning and refactoring.
