          title: "Ten things we've learned from running production infrastructure at Google"
          description: |
            Google SRE principles emphasize reliability, standardization, and blamelessness. The talk will cover measurement, on-call duty, and automation parts of the job. It will highlight approaches that are used to manage change, deal with inevitable outages, and avoiding complexity. Ten lessons is an approximation of some of key learnings, that remain valuable despite, or even because, of efforts put into making large and complex systems easier to operate.
            (Presented in English)

          title: "Knowing your State Machines"
          description: |
            Web development is not just about delivering a response. It is also about writing good code. The state pattern will help you move complexity from being all over your code to one or more state machines. This talk will introduce state machines, show how to identify uses of them and implement them in your Symfony application in an object oriented manner using the Symfony Workflow component.
            (Presented in English)
