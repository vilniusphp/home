          title: Temporal - application orchestrator
          description: |
            Managing multiple services, developers spend too much time writing
            code to ensure the reliability and communication of their
            applications, rather than on creating business value for their
            companies. Creating your own ways to orchestrate services implies a
            great cost of money and time. This is where Temporal comes in, let's
            find out how it's used and what it offers.
