          title: NFT ART: what is it? why it is so expensive and does the industry have a future?
          description: |
            In a few secs, Oxana will tell why she chose this topic; why it is
            interesting for her, and what miracles happening with NFT art.
            Before the advent of blockchain and NFT, we never could own
            something completely digital. We downloaded images and videos
            sharing them as we liked, without any regard for copyright. Now,
            this trend is changing as it expands opportunities not only for
            artists. For example, did you know that Jack Dorsey, the billionaire
            co-founder of Twitter sold the very first tweet for just under $3
            million? No? So today you will learn even more examples with
            impressive art costs, will be able to identify which type of NFT Art
            is generative and not generative, and learn how NFT works and what
            storage methods can be used, so stay focused as some facts might be
            mind-blowing and welcome to the NFT party.

              What helped us to make releases from two per month to 7 per day
              and speed up the process from two hours to 7 minutes.
