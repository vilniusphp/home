        - name: "Sergej Kurakin (Ovoko)"
          title: "Photography and Software Engineering – I thought it’s different… but it appears it’s not."
          description: |
            Drawing from over 20 years of experience in IT and software development, coupled with more than 3 years
            as a novice photographer, Sergej Kurakin has uncovered surprising parallels between his creative passion
            and his professional work. Join him as he explores the unexpected similarities. (Presented in Lithuanian)
        - name: "Darius Kasperavičius (KiloHealth)"
          title: "Cloud Design Patterns in Practice"
          description: |
            While many of us are familiar with the classic “Gang of Four” design patterns and other commonly used
            design paradigms in object-oriented languages, there exists a world of cloud-specific design patterns.
            Darius Kasperavičius will guide us through the cloud design patterns he has applied in Kilo Health Core
            projects, offering a fascinating blend of theory and practical application. (Presented in Lithuanian)
